## üîé Overview

![HASSOD-gif](assets/HASSOD.gif)

HASSOD is a fully self-supervised approach for object detection and instance segmentation, demonstrating a significant improvement over the previous state-of-the-art methods by discovering a more comprehensive range of objects. Moreover, HASSOD understands the part-to-whole object composition like humans do, while previous methods cannot. Notably, we improve class-agnostic Mask AR from 20.2 to 22.5 on LVIS, and from 17.0 to 26.0 on SA-1B. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Instructions
To use our code and reproduce the results, please follow these detailed documents step by step:
